Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

When we ran few amount of simulation, countires which are "weak" popped up with high winning chance.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It feels that >= 10000 simulation provides significant enough data to call the prediction "good enough".
