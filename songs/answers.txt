1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
  I would run the following queries:
    SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

2.Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
  I think we should also include the loudness, speechiness and temp into the equation.
  I think it would also be better if we would specify the aura of each album instead of the overall aura of the band/author.
