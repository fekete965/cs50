sort1 uses: Bubble

How do you know?:
  The average and worst case scenario's time complexity is O(Pow(N, 2)).
  The the best case scenario (using an already sorted list) time complexity is O(N).
  Comparing the the timestamps from sorted50000 and random50000 verified behaviour above.

sort2 uses: Merge

How do you know?:
  Merge sort's time complexity is O(logN)
  No matter how big, small, sorted or random the data set is, the completion time is barely different.

sort3 uses: Selection

How do you know?: 
  Selection sort's time complexity is O(N)
  Comparing the times after running each randomXXXXX.txt confirmed this behaviour.
